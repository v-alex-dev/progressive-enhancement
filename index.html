		<h3>The story</h3>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to 		commiserate. They said, <i><q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q></i> The farmer said, <i><q><mark>Maybe</mark>.</q></i> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <i><q>Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q></i> The farmer again said, <i></i></p>
			<p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <i><q>Oh dear, that’s too <tag class="bad">bad</tag>, </q>and the farmer responded, <q><mark>Maybe</mark>.</q></i> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <i><q>Isn’t that great!</q></i> Again, he said, <i><q><mark>Maybe</mark>.</q></i></p>
			<p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <tag class="good">good</tag> or <tag class="bad">bad</tag> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<p><tag class="good">Good</tag> and <tag class="bad">Bad</tag> are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
